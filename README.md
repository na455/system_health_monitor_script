# System Health Check Script

This is a simple Bash script I wrote to monitor and report the current system health status on a Linux machine.

My name is Nada Hussein, and this project is part of my practice in Linux Administration and Bash Scripting. It collects essential system information in a clean and organized way and saves it to a report file.
